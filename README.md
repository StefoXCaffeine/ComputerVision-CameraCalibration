The goal of this assignment was to calibrate a camera using the Direct Linear Transform method to obtain the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera.

Once the parameters were estimated, it was required to compute the pixels corresponding to the floor in the acquired image. To assess the quality of the calibration, the DLT method was computed with 6, 12 and 24 points o the image.

The MSE was then computed over a set of test points over the floor. In particular, a 4-fold cross validation technique was used to measure the average MSE over the 4 folds.
